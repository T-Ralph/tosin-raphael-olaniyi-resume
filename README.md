## Challenges
- You can add buttons to show/hide sections of your resume based on what the employers want to see. For instance - I could have a series of buttons labelled “Tech”, “Forestry”, “Odd Jobs”, then on each job item in my resume I could have class = “Tech” or class = “Tech OddJobs” (notice OddJobs is one word now). Then the javascript handler for each button would toggle the visibility of each job item based on the class name. You can research how to make a collapsible as well.
- You can use FontAwesome to add icons for social media websites BUT your social media account must be appropriate to show to potential employers. For instance - I don’t mind employers seeing my Twitter, but I would never let an employer see my Facebook.
- You can add a portfolio page or section to show visual content. You may not be an artist or a photographer, but screenshots of your own applications can be a nice touch for people who are not technologically inclined enough to look at your github. People like Human Resource managers may really appreciate this touch.
